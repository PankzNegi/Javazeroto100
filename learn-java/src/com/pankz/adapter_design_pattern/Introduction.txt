Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that helps us to connect legacy or third party code
that exposes similar functonality with a different interface.
It is also known as wrapper as it wraps an existing code with a new interface making it compatible for client
It is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together.
The object that joins these unrelated interface is called Adapter.
Bridge gaps between two interfaces.
