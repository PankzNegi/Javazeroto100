public class UncheckedException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name=null;
        printLength(name); //here compiler will not throw any error at compile time

    }
    private static void printLength(String myString)
    {
        System.out.println(myString.length());
    }
}
But this code will explode at run time and throw nullpointerexception
UNCHECKED--->Java doesn't makes us catch it with a try catch block and doesn't even make us
declare it here in method signature that we might throw a nullpointerexception.
But we can solve it via try catch block or throws clause in method signature.



How java knows which exception is checked or unchecked??

"RuntimeException" are unchecked exception.

Which are not runtime exception are checked exception.
