Exception-->Exceptions is the subclass of throwable class.
We are trying to open one file and it doesn't exist  that is an exception.
You are looking for an input and user is not giving you the input that is an exception.
Trying to run an application but cpu is unavailable that is an exception.
Dividing number by zero is also an exception
Exception are those which we can handle.
We can't handle errors
Error---.JVM is not working,Memory unavailable e.t.c
Exceptions are of two types one is Checked exception and other is Unchecked.
Checked(compile time exception) means you are allowing your user to handle it.(It can be handle)
Unchecked(Runtimexception).
Statements are of two types-Normal and Critical.
Critical statements comes under try block which throws an object of exception.
Catch block will catch that object of exception.
e.g int k=i/j; j might be zero hence it is critical statement
try
{
int k=i/j;
}
catch
{
//catch exception
}
There can be multiple catch statement under one try block.
Exception is the super class of all general exceptions.
Arithematic,Arrayoutofbound,IOexception extends "Exception"
catch(Exception e)
{
handle all types of exception
}
Checked--->If user can handle it fine but if not pass it above then above
c throws an exception to b if b can handle it fine otherwise ,b throws an exception to a and so on....
so you can throw an exception using "throws" clause.
Checked--->IOException,SQLException,MalformedURLException
Unchecked-->RuntimeException(Arrayindexoutofbound,Arithematic,NumberFormat,ClasscastException,Nullpointer e.t.c)
ArithematicException extends RuntimeException
RuntimeException extends Exception
Exception extends Throwable
