Factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasess and
based on input,we need to return an object of one of the subclass.
This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class




IT IS WIDELY USED WHEN----->
1-When the implementation of the "interface or an abstract class is exposed to change frequently".
2-When we multiple subclasses of superclass

ADVANTAGE- Code for interface rather than implementation
Less coupled and easy to extend(exposing it from client)
