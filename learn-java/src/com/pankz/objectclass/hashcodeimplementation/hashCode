We must override hashcode in every class that override equals/
Otherwise it will not work properly in collection such as HashMap & HashSet.
Contract of hashCode--
The basic rule of the contract states that if two objects are equal to each other based on equals() method, then the hash code must be the same.
 but if the hash code is the same, then equals() can return false.


 General Contract for hashCode-->\

The hashCode() method should return the same integer value for the same object for each calling of this method unless the value stored in the object is modified.
If two objects are equal(according to equals() method) then the hashCode() method should return the same integer value for both the objects.
But, it is not necessary that the hashCode() method will return the distinct result for the objects that are not equal (according to equals() method).
